Note: 

It only works for all the pdf files inside a folder

1. You need to have the PyPDF package installed [installer guide](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.0/user/installation.html)
2. Type the exact folder path in the folder_path variable (Example: /user/name/desktop/folder)
3. Run the progra, and then type the string you want to search. 

In my case i wanted to search for my specific certificate inside a folder that had 450+ other certificates, so I put in the folder address and then typed my name as the string and then it gave me the file name of my certificate, which then I "ctrl + f" and it saved me lots of time
